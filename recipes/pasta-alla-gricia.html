    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta alla Gricia esentially takes <a href="../recipes/cacio-e-pepe.html">Cacio e Pepe</a>
      as a base and adds guanciale or pancetta to it to make pasta alla gricia.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon salt
      <li>1 cup guanciale or pancetta, sliced</li>

      <li>Add salt to the water and get it boiling.</li>
      <li>Add your meat onto a cold pan, and set it to medium-low heat to render
        the fat. Let the meat crisp up and get a little browning.</li>

        and put it in a bowl, set aisde.</li>
      <li>Grate some black pepper into the pan with the pork fat, and stir it

        spoonfuls of pasta into the pan. Mix with the pork fat and pepper.</li>
      <li>As soon as the pasta is al dente, reserve 1-2 cups of pasta water and
        trasnfer pasta from pot to pan. Mix to combine with the pork fat, black
        pepper, and water mixture. Add additional pasta water as needed.</li>
      <li>Once pasta is mixed to your liking, turn off the stove and add in the
        cheese. Mix.</li>
      <li>Add in the cooked guanciale or pancetta bits. Mix again.</li>
      <li>Plate it up.</li>
      <li>Additionally, garnish with a few cracks of fresh black pepper and
        some extra cheese.</li>
