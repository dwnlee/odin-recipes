    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cacio e pepe is a simple, yet classic Roman pasta dish. It only takes a
      few ingredients: pasta, cheese, and black pepper.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups of Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns, grounded</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, reserve 1 cup of pasta water from after cooking the spaghetti.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a pot with water enough to cover at least half the spaghetti.</li>
      <li>Add salt to the water and get it boiling.</li>
      <li>In another pan, start toasting your pepper on medium-low heat.</li>
      <li>Once the pasta is about 1-2 minutes from being al dente, transfer 1-2 
        scoops of pasta water from the pot to the pan.</li>
      <li>Reserve 1 cup of extra pasta water.</li>
      <li>Start mixing the pepper with the water in the pan.</li>
      <li>Transfer pasta from pot to pan when al dente, mix pasta with pepper
        and water. Add additional pasta water as needed in little bits.</li>
      <li>Once the pasta is mixed to your liking, turn off the heat, add in the
        cheese and start mixing until cheese is combined and it turns into a 
        sauce with the pasta water.</li>
      <li>Additionally, garnish with a few cracks of fresh black pepper and some
        grated or shredded cheese.
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
