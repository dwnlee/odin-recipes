    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara builds on top of <a href="./pasta-alla-gricia.html">Pasta alla Gricia</a>
      by incoporating eggs into the recipe to build a creamy pasta sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A large glass or metal bowl that would fit on top of the pot used to
        boil pasta</li>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 pound guanciale or pancetta, thickly cubed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Pecorino Romano, finely grated</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Parmesan, finely grated</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoon black pepper, grounded</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, reserve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 cup of pasta water</li>
      <li>A few tablespoons of the rendered fat from the guanciale or pancetta</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut guanciale or pancetta into thick cubes.</li>
      <li>In the large glass or metal bowl (the one that can fit on top of the pasta pot), combine the cheese, black pepper, and eggs. Mix until it reaches a paste-like consistency.
      <li>Fill a pot with water enough to cover at least half the spaghetti.</li>
      <li>Add salt to the water and get it boiling.</li>
      <li>Add your meat onto a cold pan, and set it to medium-low heat to render the fat. Let the meat crisp up and get 
        a little browning.</li>
      <li>Once the meat is crisped up and starts browning a little, use a spatual to push the meat onto one side of the pan seperating it from the rendered fat. Turn the heat off.</li>
      <li>Drain the rendered fat into a smaller bowl. Reserve a few tablespoons of the rendered fat.</li>
      <li>Once the pasta is cooked to al dente, transfer from pot to pan. Reserve 1-2 cups of pasta water. Mix the pasta with the cooked pork and any remaining rendered fat left in the pan.</li>
      <li>Do not pour away the pasta water. In the pot with the pasta water, turn the heat down to low, but large bowl on top.</li>
      <li>Work quickly! Transfer pasta with pork from pan into the large bowl. Combine pasta with paste-like mixture by mixing quickly. The paste should start to emulsify into a sauce. Add in bits of pasta water but keep mixing.</li>
      <li>If you've done it right, the eggs should not be cooked like scrambled eggs, but instead a glossy sauce.</li>
      <li>Transfer pasta to a plate or bowl.</li>
      <li>Garnish with freshly cracked black pepper and some extra cheese.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
